Lem: If Δ is delzant, the dual subdivision of $T_Δ$ contains at most one integer point, $0$.
Cor: The vertices in $T_Δ$ look like tropical hyperplanes, except for the ones intersecting $0$ in the dual subdivision.

Fun fact: Δ is compact iff its dual subdivision contains $0$.

Def: thin branch cut:
